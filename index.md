## About Me

Hello! I go by **Hana Gabrielle**, as this is my preferred first name.

I graduated from Cornell University in 2021 with a B.S. in Information Science, Systems, and Technology and a minor in Science and Technology Studies. At Wells Fargo, I worked as a Program Analyst and Technology Business Systems Associate.

Feel free to contact me at hanagabrielleb91@gmail.com if you would like to chat about data science, human computer interaction, accessibility, mental health, and anything else. 

## About My Project

I will be developing a sensor mat system with the research team that detects whether people with visual impairments are in sync with an aerobics workout (e.g., step aerobics). If they are not in sync, we will deliver personalized verbal feedback.
