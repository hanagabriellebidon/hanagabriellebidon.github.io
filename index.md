## About Me

Hello! I go by **Hana Gabrielle**, as this is my preferred first name.

I graduated from Cornell University in 2021 with a B.S. in Information Science, Systems, and Technology and a minor in Science and Technology Studies. At Wells Fargo, I worked as a Program Analyst and Technology Business Systems Associate.

Feel free to contact me at hanagabrielleb91@gmail.com if you would like to chat about data science, human computer interaction, accessibility, mental health, or anything else. 

## About My Mentor

Kyle Rector is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and a member of the Public Digital Arts Cluster at the University of Iowa. She conducts research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Accessibility. She is especially interested in developing technologies that enhance quality of life for people who are blind or low vision in domains including exercise and art.

She has broader interests in HCI. For instance, she has collaborated on other projects including email and attachment management in enterprise, an American Sign Language Dictionary, and inclusive play for neurodiverse children.

## About My Project

I will be developing a sensor mat system with the research team that detects whether people with visual impairments are in sync with an aerobics workout (e.g., step aerobics). If they are not in sync, we will deliver personalized verbal feedback.
